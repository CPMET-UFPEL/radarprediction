# Welcome to Ferret Model

This is a model writed in python using the technique of deep learning for predict the path of systems observed in radar meteorological of Centro de Pesquisas e Previs√µes Meteorologicas (CPPMET) from Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPel)

Ferret needs a initial condition for make predictions and he show the path of center max pixel. In this version the model has tested prediction until 1 hour, and had promisous results if we consider just path of the systems.

# Model use the following libs:

- TensorFlow;
- h5py;
- Numpy
- Basemap
- Hagelslag
- Pyart
